C# Warrior
==============
C# Warrior is an adaptation of the [Ruby Warrior site](https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior) for the C# language. It is designed to teach the fundamentals of C# to programmers who are learning the language for the first time. It is NOT designed to teach programming fundamentals; it assumes that players have a basic understanding of programming already.

Building
--------
